## Professional Experience

`January 2018 – ongoing` *Cisco Systems, Bedfont Lakes, Feltham*

__Software Engineer in Test, Cloud Media Engineering__
- **Developer of the testing framework**, including autotests, for the video composition and transcoding service of Webex, Cisco’s world-leading cloud videoconferencing platform.
- **Responsible for** the programming of and experimentation of realistic simulations of new features for an automated testing pipeline. This involves: generating, sending, receiving, decoding and analysing of media packets (using Python bindings for GStreamer), as well as the network signalling (using Docker on Linux) and platform development (with Kubernetes and AWS) necessary for realistic simulations.
- **Responsible for** maintaining, improving, and ensuring the veracity of the automated testing pipeline, which allows for the continuous deployment of code to datacentres across the globe.
- **Responsible for** around-the-clock continuous operation of the service, including responding to alerts and resolving urgent customer incidents in real-time.
- **Presented** “Anatomy of an Autotest Architecture” at Cisco TechZone X UK 2020.

__Software Engineer, Performance and Scalability__
- Introduction to Citrix's virtualization software.

`July – August 2016` *ISIS Neutron Beam & Source, Rutherford Appleton Laboratories, Oxford*

__Summer Research Intern in Small-Angle Neutron Beam Scattering__
- Using Python, I rewrote and redesigned a programme to calculate the reflection angles and shadow lengths of a neutron beam through a system of slits.

`August 2012 – September 2013` *Sharp Laboratories of Europe, Oxford*

__Year in Industry Student, Display Research & Development__
- Responsible for testing and researching the optical properties of LCDs used in the smartphone, laptop and television industries.
