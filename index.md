## Professional Experience

`January 2018 – ongoing` *Cisco Systems, Bedfont Lakes, Feltham*

__Software Engineer in Test, Cloud Media Engineering__
- Developer of the testing framework, including autotests, for the video composition and transcoding service of Webex, Cisco’s world-leading cloud videoconferencing platform.
- Responsible for programming realistic simulations of new features of this microservice for its automated testing pipeline.
- This includes the generating, sending, receiving, decoding and analysing of media packets (using Python bindings for GStreamer), as well as the network signalling (using Docker on Linux) and platform development (with Kubernetes and AWS) necessary to interact with the service in a realistic way.
- Member of the team responsible for maintaining, improving, and ensuring the veracity of the automated testing pipeline, which continuously deploys code daily to datacentres across the globe.
- Member of the team responsible for around-the-clock continuous operation of the service, including responding to alerts and resolving incidents in real-time.

`September 2017 – January 2018` *Citrix Systems UK, Chalfont St. Peter*

__Software Engineer in Performance and Scalability__
- Introduction to Citrix's virtualization software.

`June 2016 – July 2016` *ISIS Neutron Beam, Rutherford Labs, Oxford*

__Summer Research Intern in Small-Angle Neutron Beam Scattering__
- Using Python, I rewrote and redesigned a programme to calculate the reflection angles and shadow lengths of a neutron beam through a system of slits.

`August 2012 – September 2013` *Sharp Laboratories of Europe, Oxford*

__Year in Industry Student__
- One-year placement researching the optical properties of LCDs used in the smartphone, laptop and television industries.
- 2nd name on a publication of a study investigating the limits of human visual perception at increasing pixel densities.
- Published in the Society of Information Display’s 2013 international digest of technical papers.
- Responsible for organising and analysing large sets of both detector-collected & human-factors data.
- Experience building numerical models of reflectivity and testing them against results from self-designed experiments.
